## Thinking in React

### Props vs State

- A parents state can be a childs prop.
- Things that aren't state
  - Does it remain unchanged over time?
  - Is it passed in from a parent via props?
  - Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component?
- Identify where state should live
  - I believe this is a huge problem in React given the multiple state management sub-libraries available to handle it
